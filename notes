# Smart Contracts
For games smart contracts have the advantage of transparency and immutability.

## Transparency
Players know how the game works.
## Immutability
The game cannot change 

Any address that the contract is intended to be paid to by the contract must be 'payable' to the contract
Ex: `address payable winner`
